"""
The function takes parameters q, p and g and generates public-private key pairs for both the payer and the payee.
The sender's private key payer_alpha and public key payer_beta are generated, and only the payee's public key is used.
"""


"""
The signing procedure is applied with the digital signature algorithm.
The signature is created using the converted byte version of the message, q, p, g parameters and payer_alpha, and as a result, s and h representing the signature are obtained.
